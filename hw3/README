This code is modified from "s_04/lab5_dynamic_udev.c".

The basic function of this code and "s_04/lab5_dynamic_udev.c" is:

     Adapt the dynamic registration driver to use udev to create the device node on the fly.

The operations for devices are:
   read
   write
   open
   release
   lseek

Modifications:

1. add new data structure to organize the essential component.
   struct asp_mycdrv{
       struct list_head list;
       struct cdev dev;
       char *ramdisk;
       struct semaphore sem;
       int devNo; 
   };

2. Device nodes are created by the driver. All the device nodes are stored in the linked list--"struct list_head".

3. A device cannot be opened concurrently.
